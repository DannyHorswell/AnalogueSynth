# AnalogueSynth
Analogue synth emulator

Welcome to my analogue synth emulator.

In the 80s, I used to play around with analogue synthasizers. I had a Korg Detla, Roland alpha Juno, and a Roland D50, to play with when I was a teenager.

This project I created a few years back to try and recreate an analogue synth using a RPI 2. I had some success but found the RPI2 was not man enough for
the job. So this was left sittin on a drive at home for some time. Now I recently purchased a RPI 400 which is much fater, so thought would be a good
project to see if I can make it work on that.

The initial version of this I wrote using ALSA, when ressurecting this project, I founf alsa was very flaky (or maybe my code was) so I decided to change to use
PortAudio, which I have used for a cople of other projects.
